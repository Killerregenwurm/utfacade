This directory includes the .NET-Bindings for Ubitrack.

Unfortunately, SCons does not support compiling .NET code. Therefore, only
the C++-Part of the bindings is compiled automatically. To compile the .NET
class libary, you need to open the .sln file in VisualStudio manually, after 
the C++-DLL was built.
